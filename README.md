# Data Structures and Algorithm Notes

**NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL A WORKING PROGRESS, SO PLEASE BE PATIENT, I BELIEVE THE BEST THINGS TAKE TIME (CERTAINLY NOT FOREVER, LOL) ðŸš§** 

Greetings Fellow Travelers, here is a repository dedicated to my learning journey for data structures and algorithms. i hope this documentation can serve as a reference for both myself and anyone viewing. this would containing my notes, list of resources as well as any helpful information necessary in the learning of this topic.

**Note:** This is the first time i am attempting to document something as extensive as i hope to with this journey, it is also some-what of a challenge i have given myself that i believe if successful, i would be thanking myself that i did.
as they say,

so let's get started, shall we!

## Introduction

In deciding to learn this topic, it was rather daunting to fathom the sheer volume of information, so i turned to the solutions to all problems (lol), a simple, one sentence prompt on ChatGPT and a simple Google search. With the response, i was able to get navigate a starting point.

### some relevant material:

- [GeeksForGeeks' Complete Roadmap to Learn DSA from scratch.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-roadmap-to-learn-dsa-from-scratch/)
- [DSA Roadmap: Learn Data Structures and Algorithms [2025]](https://www.scaler.com/blog/dsa-roadmap/)

From the premise of these two articles below, *the advised roadmap to learn data structures and algorithms a*re as follows:

1. [Learn and master the fundamentals of a Programming language](./01-learning-a-language-for-dsa/introduction.md).
2. [Learn Time and Space Complexity Analysis](./02-time-and-space-complexity/index.md).
3. [Learn the Basics of individual Data Structures and Algorithms](./03-leaning-individual-dsa/index.md).
4. [Continous learning, Practice, Practice, Practice more](./04-continous-learnig-and-practice/index.md).
5. [Participate and Compete in Competitions and Hackathons](./05-competing/index.md).

Now, i'll try to break down these 5 steps into more manageable pieces in their dedicated pages to facilitate tracking progress and managing resources for each step. you are allowed to snoop around in the repo, however, i will do my best to make sure everything is properly organized and linked.
