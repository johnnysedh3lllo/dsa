# 01. Learning a language for DSA

## Introduction

they say having a deep understanding of the programming language you are going to use to practice DSA is crucial, i agree. i have been writing Javascript for 2+ years now and i think i would be confident enough to use it for DSA. However, i wanted to use this learning journey as an opportunity to learn another language, a language i've always wanted to learn so i can get into graphics programming, C/C++.

Most would advice to go with what you're already comfortable with, i advice this for anyone not up to the challenge of learning a new language. I think learning a new language for DSA after already knowing one, can be an enlightening journey because you get to observe patterns and have a more holistic view of programming in general, given your experience in a previous language and your "soon-to-have" experience in this new language.

i also picked C/C++ because C is kinda the mother of all modern languages and it would be exciting to view programming for C's perspective.

**Note:** i advise to go with a language you're comfortable with, if you're not up for the challenge. however, if you are, i leave with this quote for your morale.

Also, if you are up for the challenge but wouldn't like to use C/C++, here are some recommended languages

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

i would say, any language of your choice, however, picking a popular language would be beneficial in terms of seeking assistance, finding learning resources, following walkthroughs and explanations, etc.
