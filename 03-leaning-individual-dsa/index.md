# 03. Learning a individual data structures and algorithms

## My thoughts

My first thought was to learn all the data structures necessary then move on to learn all the algorithms, then proceed to building projects.
However, this may not be ideal from my research, given that the abstract nature of learning data structures and algorithms, most of the concepts would be abstract and it is important to apply most of these concepts to make the learning complete. So in this regard, i will be attempting to list all the data structures and algorithms while breaking them down into basic, intermediate and advanced.

_Note: to achieve this hierarchical order, i prompted both ChatGPT and Claude to observe patterns in the hierarchy._
